                        In the following term paper, I want to introduce my reader to them <i> corporate social responsibility </i> (hereby CSR). In the first chapter, I am going to deal with the understanding of the CSR and explain how we one define it, what are main theories and goals behind it and lastly show several arguments that support as well as discourage applying it. In the second part, I going to give the reader an insight into application of CSR strategy, specifically in the marketspace, work environment and community. In the final chapter, I am going to outline briefly how firms can manage social responsibility through the help of other parties (e.g. NGOs) and provide a look into the reporting as it represents results of CSR activities.

                    <h4 id="intro">1.1.  Its definition and theoretical foundation</h3>    

                    <p>
                        Before I define CSR as a term, let me start with a brief look into its history. It appeared at the beginning of 20th century in the USA as corporations come under attack from their employees (e.g. social unrest related to working conditions) and communities because of being "<em>too powerful</em>" and engaging in "<em>antisocial and anticompetitive practices</em>" [Laweb13, p. 47]. Because of that, the government tried to limit firms’ power by introducing e.g. labour, antitrust and consumer-protection laws in addition to other forms of regulation (e.g. in the banking sector) [Laweb13, p. 47].  
                    </p>  

                    <p>
                        Being criticised and facing uncertain future, many great leaders such as Andrew Carnegie (the steelmaker), Henry Ford or John D. Rockefeller began using their power for volunteering their time and money for social activities becoming later great philanthropists who gave most of their wealth to charities and other foundations. These were the beginnings of corporate social responsibility initiatives [Laweb13, p. 47]. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        During the last century, the CSR was continuingly evolving so that in the 50s and 60s it was much more about managers being stewards [Laweb13, p. 49]. At that time, leaders saw themselves as trustees acting in the public interest. They were tasked to control vast resources (e.g. land etc.), which could easily affect other people’s lives. Thus, they had "<em>to act with a special degree of responsibility in making</em>" any business decisions [Laweb13, p. 49]. For example, to balance social differences they were founding charities and other social organisations helping people in need. By doing that, they were improving and further strengthening their own (and firm’s) reputation and image as well. 
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        In the late 90s, CSR has evolved into being much more organised and carefully crafted strategy, which incorporated work of NGOs, think tanks and many other stakeholders [Laweb13, p. 59]. During second half of 20th century different terms such as business ethics, corporate citizenship or corporate social responsiveness emerged and were 'competing', yet all of them have been used to relate to the same "<em>themes such as community, morals, and accountability</em>" (Schwartz & Carroll, 2008) [Okpido13, p. 4]. That way, CSR "<em>focuses on corporate self-regulation mainly associated with ethical issues, human rights, health and safety</em>", social and environmental protection and "<em>voluntary initiatives involving support for community projects and philanthropy</em>" (Carroll & Shabana, 2010) [Okpido13, p. 4]. 
                    </p>                    

                    <p>
                        Many definitions of CSR have come out in the management and business literature, as even nowadays there are vast disagreements over the appropriate role of the corporation in society [Crane13, p. 7]. Moreover, there is also no consensus if CSR should exists in the first place at all. Crane (2013, p. 5) provides a dozen of explanations of the term based on different international organisations but to summarize all of them, social accountability tries to cover "<em>the broad areas of responsibilities corporations have to the societies within which they operate</em>" [Okpido13, p. 4]. In the academic literature, authors commonly talk about six core characteristics of CSR, which in the following I want to present [Crane13, p. 9].  
                    </p>                    

                    <p>
                       The first one is a <i>voluntary</i> aspect, namely companies’ responsibility will sometimes go beyond the legal minimum; for example when the firm introduces special "<em>easy-to-understand</em>" calorie labelling on food and beverage items to slow down a potential governmental regulation [Crane13, p. 9f.]. The second core concept of CSR is going <i>beyond the philanthropy</i>, as the entire firm’s operations need "<em>to be integrated into normal business practices rather than being left simply</em>" to ‘additional and discretionary’ activities [Crane13, p. 9f.]. Third principle of CSR is engaging in <i>practices and values</i>, which are moral, ethical, fair and can underpin the business not only in social issues but also in respect to the society and the whole environment at large. 
                    </p>                    

                    <p>
                        Fourth characteristic is the <i>social and economic alignment</i>. This asks a major question, namely how can companies be economically independent and profitable at the same time being socially responsible [Crane13, p. 11]. In fact, here firms try to balance different stakeholder interests, which (sometimes) lead to the conflict with (not only) profitability. The second to last principle is about <i>managing externalities</i> [Crane13, p. 10]. As an example, Crane (2013, p. 10) talks about pollution since communities bear the cost of manufacturers’ actions. In such case, the CSR needs to be voluntary as the firm should invest into technologies that prevent pollution in the first place. The last aspect of CSR, authors are often writing about, is trying to <i>consider a range of interest and impacts among a variety of different stakeholders other than just shareholders</i> [Crane13, p. 11]. Although there is a disagreement to what degree shareholder must be taken into account, most authors agree that prosperity of a company relies on consumers, employees, suppliers as well as other people in the community too.  
                    </p>                    

                    <p>
                        One particular explanation of CSR stands out, first defined by Archie B. Carroll in 1979, who wrote that "<em>The social responsibility of business encompasses the economic, legal, ethical and discretionary [philanthropic] expectations that a society has of organizations at a given point in time</em>" [Carroll79, p. 500]. While some responsibilities are required, others are only desired and all of them are famously illustrated in Carroll’s pyramid as they "<em>address the incentives for initiatives that are useful in identifying specific kinds of benefits that flow back to companies, as well as society</em>" [Okpido13, p. 5].
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The economic responsibility of a business is fundamental requirement to others. The company’s goal is "<em>to produce goods and services that society desires and to sell them at a profit</em>" (Carroll, 1979, p. 500). "<em>Carroll claims that by doing so, businesses fulfil their primary responsibility as economic units in society</em>" [Okpido13, p. 5]. Such principle of profit maximization is further "<em>endorsed and amplified</em>" by many classical economic views, led by Milton Friedman [Okpido13, p. 5]. He argued that there is only one social responsibility of business, namely "<em>to use its resources to engage in activities designed to increase its profits so long as it stays within the rules of the game</em>" (i.e. without fraud) [Quote; Okpido13, p. 5]. Even though there are further differences between classical economic views "<em>in terms of corporate profit, the notion of economic responsibility in terms of financial profit to stockholders is accepted and required</em>" by all views [Okpido13, p. 6]. 
                    </p>

                    <img src="http://www.csrquest.net/imagefiles/CSR%20Pyramid.jpg" width="700">

                    <p>
                        The legal responsibility of business "<em>refers to the positive and negative obligations put on businesses by the laws and regulations of the society in which it operates</em>" (Carroll & Shabana, 2010) [Okpido13, p. 6]. In regard to it, some authors (e.g. De Schutter, 2008) advocate expansion of legal responsibility "<em>to encompass more regulation</em>" as they assert that regulation "<em>is necessary for the fulfilment of CSR</em>" [Okpido13, p. 6]. Moreover, they "<em>question the ability of the free market mechanism to support CSR activities</em>" (see Valor, 2008; Williamson, Lynch-Wood, & Ramsay, 2006) [Okpido13, p. 6f.].
                        <br>
                        "<em>In contrast, opponents of regulation argue that the free market mechanism promotes the interest of individuals, and in turn society, by rewarding CSR activities that are actually favoured by individuals</em>" [Okpido13, p. 7]. Therefore, CSR activities that market doesn’t reward are precisely those "<em>that individuals do not value and are therefore unwilling to support</em>" (Carroll & Shabana, 2010) [Okpido13, p. 7].
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        While "<em>economic and legal responsibilities symbolize ethical norms about fairness and justice</em>", ethical responsibility "<em>refers to those activities and practices that are expected or prohibited by society even though they are not codified into law</em>" (Carroll, 1991) [Okpido13, p. 7]. In basic terms, it describes what society expects above economic and legal expectations/requirements. Carroll (1991) claims that ethical responsibility represents those standards and norms "<em>that reflect a concern for what (…), employees, shareholders, and the community regard as fair, (…) or in keeping with the respect or protection of stakeholders’ moral rights</em>" [Okpido13, p. 7].  
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Lastly, there is a philanthropic responsibility at the top of pyramid, which describes "<em>those corporate activities that are in response to society’s expectation that businesses be good corporate citizens</em>" – essentially promoting human welfare and goodwill (Carroll, 1991) [Okpido13, p.7; Bussoc10, p. 12]. Carroll (1991) explains that financial contributions or executive time to the arts, education or the community can be regarded as a philanthropy because it has neither ethical nor legal basis. The difference between philanthropy and ethical responsibility is that the first one "<em>is not expected in an ethical or moral sense</em>" [Okpido13, p. 7]. Hence, philanthropy is voluntary for businesses, yet on the other hand, "<em>there is always the societal expectation [desire] that businesses provide it</em>" (Okpido13, p. 7]. 
                    </p>                    
                    
                    <h3 id="businessCase">1.2.  The business case for and against CSR</h3> 
                    <p>
                        Now that the reader understands what CSR means and what its core concepts are, one can look at benefits and costs associated with it. However, before I go further it needs to be said that CSR is one of those terms, which are heavily dependent on external factors and environments, e.g. the country businesses are in. In fact, CSR in Japan and Germany will always mean something different (and thus have different arguments) because the notion of 'responsible firm' is unique to country’s historical, cultural and societal development. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The first argument supporting CSR projects is the fact that it may discourage governmental regulation in the marketplace. In fact, when business voluntary act in support of social good (e.g. pasteurizing fresh juice drinks to increase safety of products) it may head off potential introduction of a new law, which would be costly and restrict flexibility of the business [Laweb13, p. 51]. Therefore, not only the company is "<em>accomplishing a public good</em>" but also "<em>its own private good</em>" [Laweb13, p. 51]. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The second argument begins where the last one ended, namely due to "<em>accomplishing a public good</em>", CSR promotes (long-term) other benefits for businesses too [Laweb13, p. 51]. Basically, it is in "<em>business’s long-term self-interest to be socially responsible</em>" (Carroll & Shabana, 2010) [Okpido13, p. 8]. Here, the reader can image a situation where the firm donates money to universities. On the one side, it can be very costly and don’t provide any clear return on investment (critics’ argument). On the other hand, the company can benefit from students who are more qualified as well as from the results of research the university achieves [Laweb13, p. 51]. Indeed, studies have shown that CSR "<em>provides measurable benefits to businesses</em>" (Kurucz, Barry, & Wheeler, 2008) [Okpido13, p. 8].
                    </p>  

                    <p>
                        The third argument supporting CSR activities is about increasing firm’s valuation and its reputation too [see Petrov15; Laweb13, p. 52]. Here, reputation "<em>refers to desirable or undesirable qualities associated with an organisation</em>" and it is a very <em>valuable intangible asset</em>" that "<em>helps to attract and retain better employees</em>" and customers as well [Laweb13, p. 52]. By being socially responsible, the company attracts better people, which could result into further strengthening its position in the market. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The last argument supporting CSR I want to bring up is that sometimes, social responsibility can even 'correct' mistakes that business has made (or at least try). For example, after ecological catastrophes oil businesses wanting to improve their public relationship (i.e. image etc.) start to voluntary CSR initiatives such as giving funds to ecological organisations. Thus, they 'compensate' for the harm they have caused, yet on the other hand, they need to make sure that disasters won’t happen in the first place. Not coincidently, it is argued for bigger regulation in such fields as it affects the whole planet.  
                    </p>  
                    <p>
                        Although there are many arguments in support of CSR, there is also equal number of arguments, which are against CSR. Probably the biggest one is the notion that it lowers economic efficiency and firm’s profit. As a matter of fact, there is clearly a conflict. On the one hand, CSR can bring more revenue in the longer term; yet, on the other hand, it forces the company to use its resources now and by that risking its position in the marketplace. As an example, Lawrence et al. (2013) talk about an unproductive factory, which won’t be closed due to negative social effect it would have in the community [p. 53]. As a result, the firm (and its shareholders) may financially suffer and risk its future growth. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The second argument is also closely related to the first one, as the firm (engaging in CSR) bears additional costs compared to its competitors that do not. Therefore, it is putting itself in the competitive disadvantage meaning that the "<em>competition cannot be equal</em>" for both of them [Laweb13, p. 54]. This needs to be seen also from the global perspective, namely those companies, which only obey required law, can benefit against other CSR-active companies that go beyond the law. For example, due to lower costs. 
                    </p>  
                    <p>
                       In addition to that, although CSR can be viewed as easy task (in the rhetoric 'just give the money away'), in fact it requires special skills that business leaders may lack. Lawrence et al. (2013, p. 54) report that "<em>putting businesspeople in charge of solving social problems may lead to unnecessarily expensive and poorly conceived approaches</em>". As a result, although there may be an excellent CSR strategy, it is much harder to implement it in an effective way so that it can really addresses social issues. Here, also opponents of CSR argue that it is not the business leaders who should be tasked to address them, but rather politicians who have the mandate ('being elected') to even solve them [Laweb13, p. 54]. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The fourth and last argument I want to mention here is a combination of two smaller ones. Not only CSR imposes 'hidden' costs on society, but mainly, it places responsibility on companies instead of individuals (of that company). Everybody understands that if a firm decides to make its products much safer, then it may try to recover associated costs in some other way. For example, by either increasing the price of the product (customers don’t want) or paying lower wages (employees don’t want). 
                    </p> 

                    <p>
                        Concerning the second argument, some authors argue that the responsibility should be placed on individual business leaders instead on the company as a whole – and they support that by the (misunderstood) example of The Giving Pledge where billionaires (not companies) promise to give away most of the wealth to solve social issues [Laweb13, p. 54f.]
                    </p>
                    <h3 id="summary">1.3.  Summary</h3> 

                    <p>
                        To summarize the first part of this paper, the reader should already understand that CSR’s goal is to operate firm’s operations in a more responsible way by trying to manage shareholders’ as well as stakeholders’ (e.g. government) expectations, at the same time. Under CSR, companies need to "<em>adopt standards of accountability, transparency, and sustainability</em>", because it can differentiate them, further improve their image and profitability and finally attempt to solve some problems caused by their past decisions, having an impact on the whole community and society [CSR15, Tiwari11]. 
                    </p> 

                    <p>
                        Speaking very broadly, CSR wants that business leaders take not only business responsibility but also the responsibility to protect and improve welfare of society beyond the one required by law or regulations. Hence, by doing correct 'thing', leaders contribute to social, environmental and economic goals by sharing interests of both shareholders and stakeholders [Tiwari11].
