                        In the following term paper, I want to introduce my reader to them <i> corporate social responsibility </i> (hereby CSR). In the first chapter, I am going to deal with the understanding of the CSR and explain how we one define it, what are main theories and goals behind it and lastly show several arguments that support as well as discourage applying it. In the second part, I going to give the reader an insight into application of CSR strategy, specifically in the marketspace, work environment and community. In the final chapter, I am going to outline briefly how firms can manage social responsibility through the help of other parties (e.g. NGOs) and provide a look into the reporting as it represents results of CSR activities.

                    <p>
                        Before I define CSR as a term, let me start with a brief look into its history. It appeared at the beginning of 20th century in the USA as corporations come under attack from their employees (e.g. social unrest related to working conditions) and communities because of being "<em>too powerful</em>" and engaging in "<em>antisocial and anticompetitive practices</em>" [Laweb13, p. 47]. Because of that, the government tried to limit firms’ power by introducing e.g. labour, antitrust and consumer-protection laws in addition to other forms of regulation (e.g. in the banking sector) [Laweb13, p. 47].  
                    </p>

                        There are five types of value: the book, break-up, liquidation, fundamental and lastly the market value [FTPress13]. About the fundamental value, I am going to write in the fourth chapter. For now, let me just summarize the remaining four of them. The book value refers to the accounting value – the value reported in the balance sheet. The break-up value "<em>refers to the amount that could be realized if a company were split into saleable units that could be disposed of in a negotiated transaction</em>" [FTPress13]. A recent example would be Hewlett-Packard business split, which had been analysed extensively by Aswath Damodaran [Admm14]. The next type of value is the liquidation one, which should be only used if "<em>liquidation is likely at the end of the forecast period</em>" [Koller10, p. 229]. It refers to "<em>a distress sale</em>" – i.e. such value is always lower than the book or break-up one due to the quick sale of all assets at a discount price [FTPress13]. The last value I want to mention here is the market value – simplified it is created on the public exchanges and market capitalization (share price multiple number of shares outstanding) is mostly used as its benchmark. 
                    </p>

                        Valuation of a company (sometimes part of due diligence process) is done when two companies merge or one acquires another one (M&A). Additionally, it is used on every day basis for purposes of (potential) shareholders to known the right price for firm's stock – to either sell or buy it. Moreover, Fernandez (2013) lists initial public offering (IPO) and strategic planning (e.g. selling, merging etc.) among reasons why there is a need for knowing what the company is worth. He also concludes that there are 4 key factors affecting value. It is the growth, the risk, the return (e.g. ROI/ROIC) and the interest rates. On growth, Koller et al. (2010, p. 81) write that firm "<em>creates value only when [company's] new customers, projects, or acquisitions generate ROIC [return on invested capital] greater than the costs of capital</em>". Yet, acquiring new customers or creating new projects is always very hard and the risk associated with that may be very high. Thus, it may lead to value conservation or even destruction. 
                    </p>
