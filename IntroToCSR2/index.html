                        In the following term paper, I want to introduce my reader to them <i> corporate social responsibility </i> (hereby CSR). In the first chapter, I am going to deal with the understanding of the CSR and explain how we one define it, what are main theories and goals behind it and lastly show several arguments that support as well as discourage applying it. In the second part, I going to give the reader an insight into application of CSR strategy, specifically in the marketspace, work environment and community. In the final chapter, I am going to outline briefly how firms can manage social responsibility through the help of other parties (e.g. NGOs) and provide a look into the reporting as it represents results of CSR activities.

                    <h4 id="intro">1.1.  Its definition and theoretical foundation</h3>    

                    <p>
                        Before I define CSR as a term, let me start with a brief look into its history. It appeared at the beginning of 20th century in the USA as corporations come under attack from their employees (e.g. social unrest related to working conditions) and communities because of being "<em>too powerful</em>" and engaging in "<em>antisocial and anticompetitive practices</em>" [Laweb13, p. 47]. Because of that, the government tried to limit firms’ power by introducing e.g. labour, antitrust and consumer-protection laws in addition to other forms of regulation (e.g. in the banking sector) [Laweb13, p. 47].  
                    </p>  

                    <p>
                        Being criticised and facing uncertain future, many great leaders such as Andrew Carnegie (the steelmaker), Henry Ford or John D. Rockefeller began using their power for volunteering their time and money for social activities becoming later great philanthropists who gave most of their wealth to charities and other foundations. These were the beginnings of corporate social responsibility initiatives [Laweb13, p. 47]. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        During the last century, the CSR was continuingly evolving so that in the 50s and 60s it was much more about managers being stewards [Laweb13, p. 49]. At that time, leaders saw themselves as trustees acting in the public interest. They were tasked to control vast resources (e.g. land etc.), which could easily affect other people’s lives. Thus, they had "<em>to act with a special degree of responsibility in making</em>" any business decisions [Laweb13, p. 49]. For example, to balance social differences they were founding charities and other social organisations helping people in need. By doing that, they were improving and further strengthening their own (and firm’s) reputation and image as well. 
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        In the late 90s, CSR has evolved into being much more organised and carefully crafted strategy, which incorporated work of NGOs, think tanks and many other stakeholders [Laweb13, p. 59]. During second half of 20th century different terms such as business ethics, corporate citizenship or corporate social responsiveness emerged and were 'competing', yet all of them have been used to relate to the same "<em>themes such as community, morals, and accountability</em>" (Schwartz & Carroll, 2008) [Okpido13, p. 4]. That way, CSR "<em>focuses on corporate self-regulation mainly associated with ethical issues, human rights, health and safety</em>", social and environmental protection and "<em>voluntary initiatives involving support for community projects and philanthropy</em>" (Carroll & Shabana, 2010) [Okpido13, p. 4]. 
                    </p>                    

                    <p>
                        Many definitions of CSR have come out in the management and business literature, as even nowadays there are vast disagreements over the appropriate role of the corporation in society [Crane13, p. 7]. Moreover, there is also no consensus if CSR should exists in the first place at all. Crane (2013, p. 5) provides a dozen of explanations of the term based on different international organisations but to summarize all of them, social accountability tries to cover "<em>the broad areas of responsibilities corporations have to the societies within which they operate</em>" [Okpido13, p. 4]. In the academic literature, authors commonly talk about six core characteristics of CSR, which in the following I want to present [Crane13, p. 9].  
                    </p>                    

                    <p>
                       The first one is a <i>voluntary</i> aspect, namely companies’ responsibility will sometimes go beyond the legal minimum; for example when the firm introduces special "<em>easy-to-understand</em>" calorie labelling on food and beverage items to slow down a potential governmental regulation [Crane13, p. 9f.]. The second core concept of CSR is going <i>beyond the philanthropy</i>, as the entire firm’s operations need "<em>to be integrated into normal business practices rather than being left simply</em>" to ‘additional and discretionary’ activities [Crane13, p. 9f.]. Third principle of CSR is engaging in <i>practices and values</i>, which are moral, ethical, fair and can underpin the business not only in social issues but also in respect to the society and the whole environment at large. 
                    </p>                    

                    <p>
                        Fourth characteristic is the <i>social and economic alignment</i>. This asks a major question, namely how can companies be economically independent and profitable at the same time being socially responsible [Crane13, p. 11]. In fact, here firms try to balance different stakeholder interests, which (sometimes) lead to the conflict with (not only) profitability. The second to last principle is about <i>managing externalities</i> [Crane13, p. 10]. As an example, Crane (2013, p. 10) talks about pollution since communities bear the cost of manufacturers’ actions. In such case, the CSR needs to be voluntary as the firm should invest into technologies that prevent pollution in the first place. The last aspect of CSR, authors are often writing about, is trying to <i>consider a range of interest and impacts among a variety of different stakeholders other than just shareholders</i> [Crane13, p. 11]. Although there is a disagreement to what degree shareholder must be taken into account, most authors agree that prosperity of a company relies on consumers, employees, suppliers as well as other people in the community too.  
                    </p>                    

                    <p>
                        One particular explanation of CSR stands out, first defined by Archie B. Carroll in 1979, who wrote that "<em>The social responsibility of business encompasses the economic, legal, ethical and discretionary [philanthropic] expectations that a society has of organizations at a given point in time</em>" [Carroll79, p. 500]. While some responsibilities are required, others are only desired and all of them are famously illustrated in Carroll’s pyramid as they "<em>address the incentives for initiatives that are useful in identifying specific kinds of benefits that flow back to companies, as well as society</em>" [Okpido13, p. 5].
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The economic responsibility of a business is fundamental requirement to others. The company’s goal is "<em>to produce goods and services that society desires and to sell them at a profit</em>" (Carroll, 1979, p. 500). "<em>Carroll claims that by doing so, businesses fulfil their primary responsibility as economic units in society</em>" [Okpido13, p. 5]. Such principle of profit maximization is further "<em>endorsed and amplified</em>" by many classical economic views, led by Milton Friedman [Okpido13, p. 5]. He argued that there is only one social responsibility of business, namely "<em>to use its resources to engage in activities designed to increase its profits so long as it stays within the rules of the game</em>" (i.e. without fraud) [Quote; Okpido13, p. 5]. Even though there are further differences between classical economic views "<em>in terms of corporate profit, the notion of economic responsibility in terms of financial profit to stockholders is accepted and required</em>" by all views [Okpido13, p. 6]. 
                    </p>

                    <img src="http://www.csrquest.net/imagefiles/CSR%20Pyramid.jpg" width="700">

                    <p>
                        The legal responsibility of business "<em>refers to the positive and negative obligations put on businesses by the laws and regulations of the society in which it operates</em>" (Carroll & Shabana, 2010) [Okpido13, p. 6]. In regard to it, some authors (e.g. De Schutter, 2008) advocate expansion of legal responsibility "<em>to encompass more regulation</em>" as they assert that regulation "<em>is necessary for the fulfilment of CSR</em>" [Okpido13, p. 6]. Moreover, they "<em>question the ability of the free market mechanism to support CSR activities</em>" (see Valor, 2008; Williamson, Lynch-Wood, & Ramsay, 2006) [Okpido13, p. 6f.].
                        <br>
                        "<em>In contrast, opponents of regulation argue that the free market mechanism promotes the interest of individuals, and in turn society, by rewarding CSR activities that are actually favoured by individuals</em>" [Okpido13, p. 7]. Therefore, CSR activities that market doesn’t reward are precisely those "<em>that individuals do not value and are therefore unwilling to support</em>" (Carroll & Shabana, 2010) [Okpido13, p. 7].
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        While "<em>economic and legal responsibilities symbolize ethical norms about fairness and justice</em>", ethical responsibility "<em>refers to those activities and practices that are expected or prohibited by society even though they are not codified into law</em>" (Carroll, 1991) [Okpido13, p. 7]. In basic terms, it describes what society expects above economic and legal expectations/requirements. Carroll (1991) claims that ethical responsibility represents those standards and norms "<em>that reflect a concern for what (…), employees, shareholders, and the community regard as fair, (…) or in keeping with the respect or protection of stakeholders’ moral rights</em>" [Okpido13, p. 7].  
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Lastly, there is a philanthropic responsibility at the top of pyramid, which describes "<em>those corporate activities that are in response to society’s expectation that businesses be good corporate citizens</em>" – essentially promoting human welfare and goodwill (Carroll, 1991) [Okpido13, p.7; Bussoc10, p. 12]. Carroll (1991) explains that financial contributions or executive time to the arts, education or the community can be regarded as a philanthropy because it has neither ethical nor legal basis. The difference between philanthropy and ethical responsibility is that the first one "<em>is not expected in an ethical or moral sense</em>" [Okpido13, p. 7]. Hence, philanthropy is voluntary for businesses, yet on the other hand, "<em>there is always the societal expectation [desire] that businesses provide it</em>" (Okpido13, p. 7].
