                        In the following term paper, I want to introduce my reader to the valuation of companies and their business. The paper consists of several chapters. First, I explain what value is, where it can be used and why is it important to value companies. I also write about potential danger resulting from forgetting to value value. Next, I describe Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model, which is one of many ways to estimate true value of the firm. Through explaining DCF, I am going to perform and later analyse my own valuation of Adobe Systems Inc.

                        As Koller et al. (2010) write in their book, the value is a “defining dimension of measurement in a market economy” – it measures the performance of companies. When an investor invests in a firm, he has an expectation that when he sells his stake, the value of his investment had grown “by a sufficient amount” to compensate his costs and risks, thus earning him a decent return, i.e. the performance of the firm he invested in has increased.

                        There are five types of value: the book, break-up, liquidation, fundamental and lastly the market value [FTPress13]. About the fundamental value, I am going to write in the fourth chapter. For now, let me just summarize the remaining four of them. The book value refers to the accounting value – the value reported in the balance sheet. The break-up value “refers to the amount that could be realized if a company were split into saleable units that could be disposed of in a negotiated transaction” [FTPress13]. A recent example would be Hewlett-Packard business split, which had been analysed extensively by Aswath Damodaran [Admm14]. The next type of value is the liquidation one, which should be only used if “liquidation is likely at the end of the forecast period” [Koller10, p. 229]. It refers to “a distress sale” – i.e. such value is always lower than the book or break-up one due to the quick sale of all assets at a discount price [FTPress13]. The last value I want to mention here is the market value – simplified it is created on the public exchanges and market capitalization (share price multiple number of shares outstanding) is mostly used as its benchmark.

                        Valuation of a company (sometimes part of due diligence process) is done when two companies merge or one acquires another one (M&A). Additionally, it is used on every day basis for purposes of (potential) shareholders to known the right price for firm’s stock – to either sell or buy it. Moreover, Fernandez (2013) lists initial public offering (IPO) and strategic planning (e.g. selling, merging etc.) among reasons why there is a need for knowing what the company is worth. He also concludes that there are 4 key factors affecting value. It is the growth, the risk, the return (e.g. ROI/ROIC) and the interest rates. On growth, Koller et al. (2010, p. 81) write that firm “creates value only when [company’s] new customers, projects, or acquisitions generate ROIC [return on invested capital] greater than the costs of capital. Yet, acquiring new customers or creating new projects is always very hard and the risk associated with that may be very high. Thus, it may lead to value conservation or even destruction.
